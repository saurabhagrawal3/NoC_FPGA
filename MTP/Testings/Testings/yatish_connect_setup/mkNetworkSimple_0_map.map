Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   472 out of  17,280    2%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        1,253
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           678 out of   1,253   54%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 202 out of   1,253   16%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         373 out of   1,253   29%
    Number of unique control sets:             143
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             245 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                       157 out of     640   24%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                4.06
