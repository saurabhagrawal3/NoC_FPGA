Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   486 out of  17,280    2%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        1,421
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           652 out of   1,421   45%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 385 out of   1,421   27%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         384 out of   1,421   27%
    Number of unique control sets:             182
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             297 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                       200 out of     640   31%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      2 out of      32    6%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        2

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.62

Peak Memory Usage:  967 MB
