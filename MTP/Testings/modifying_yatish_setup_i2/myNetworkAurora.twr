INFO:Timing:2698 - No timing constraints found, doing default enumeration.
INFO:Timing:3412 - To improve timing, see the Timing Closure User Guide (UG612).
INFO:Timing:2752 - To get complete path coverage, use the unconstrained paths 
   option. All paths that are not constrained will be reported in the 
   unconstrained paths section(s) of the report.
INFO:Timing:3339 - The clock-to-out numbers in this timing report are based on 
   a 50 Ohm transmission line loading model.  For the details of this model, 
   and for more information on accounting for different loading conditions, 
   please see the device datasheet.



Data Sheet report:
-----------------
No constraints were found to generate data for the Data Sheet Report section.
Use the Advanced Analysis (-a) option or generate global constraints for each
clock, its pad to setup and clock to pad paths, and a pad to pad constraint.
