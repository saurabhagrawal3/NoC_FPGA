Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    60 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  60
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         38 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as logic:                       32 out of  69,120    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              30
      Number using O5 and O6:                    2
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         6
  Number of route-thrus:                         6
    Number using O6 output only:                 5
    Number using O5 and O6:                      1

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    19 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           68
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:             8 out of      68   11%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  30 out of      68   44%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          30 out of      68   44%
    Number of unique control sets:               5
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               8 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        18 out of     640    2%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                4.05

Peak Memory Usage:  944 MB
