1) ldpc_noc_mesh_4x4_for_xilinx
2) ldpc_noc_mesh_4x4_from_cadence_v1
3) ldpc_noc_mesh_4x4_from_cadence_v2


********Folder Information:



1) ldpc_noc_mesh_4x4_for_xilinx:

Contains all the verilog files, I have created and NoC file (without synthesis)
It ensures that simulation is working and logic is matching







2) ldpc_noc_mesh_4x4_from_cadence_v1:

Contains post-synthesized file of bit_node, check_node, control_unit and bitnode_checknode_noc (top module).
These RTL files are generated by Cadence.

The remaining NoC files are origional NoC files (without synthesis).

These folder ensures that the modules, which I have created are working properly and results are matching with correct one.
 
 
 
 

 
 
3) ldpc_noc_mesh_4x4_from_cadence_v2

Contains post-synthesis files of all the modules (including CONNECT NoC)

The results are not matching with correct ones.

If you observe the signals for NoC connection ports, there is no reception of flit at any node.
Hence, problem in synthesis of NoC is found.






************File Organization


All the 3 folders have file hierarchy in the following order:

test_ldpc.v                       	 -        Testbench for all the system
bitnode_checknode_noc.v           	 -        Binding of all the components (Structural Modelling)



bit_proc_fsm.v                        	-        Bitnode implementation using FSM  as a processing element for NoC.
chk_proc_fsm.v                        	-        Checknode implementation using FSM  as a processing element for NoC.
control_unit.v                        	-        Control Unit which generates start and end of calculation (i.e.
done signal)

mkNetwork.v                       	 -        Top module for NoC

(The remaining modules are those used for CONNECT NoC )

osu018_stdcells.v			-		Cadence digital RTL library to be addded in modelsim/xilinx to verify post-synthesis simulation
