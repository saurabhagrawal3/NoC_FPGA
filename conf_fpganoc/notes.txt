An unstated/obvious side-effect is the reduction in overall synthesis+pnr time; this however is common to any multi-FPGA scheme. This also means a possibility of runtime partial reconfiguration at (one of the participating) FPGA level; also has implications on faster debuging/isolation., etc., 
These side-effects can be better exploited with our NoC like approach, being modular by construction., isolation of bugs and debug process should be more systematic compared to the adhoc partitioning approaches.

Once such (as ours) a system is available, it'd probably pay to do rapid-prototyping and debugging of even those designs that'd otherwise fit on a single-FPGA over multiple-FPGAs in order to avail of the above possibilities.
